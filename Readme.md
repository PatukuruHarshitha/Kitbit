1. Basic (BAS)
This computes the difference table for the given series to find patterns in consecutive differences.
Example:
Input series: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
•	Difference table:
markdown
Copy code
1   2   3   4   5
    1   1   1   1
Prediction: The difference remains constant at 1, so the next element is 6.
________________________________________
2. Divisions (DIV)
This computes a ratio table for the series to identify multiplicative patterns.
Example:
Input series: [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
•	Ratio table:
markdown
Copy code
2   4   8   16   32
    2   2   2    2
Prediction: The ratio is constant at 2, so the next element is 64.
________________________________________
3. Reduction (RED)
Focuses on the upper levels of a difference or ratio table to find patterns at higher levels.
Example:
Input series: [2, 5, 10, 17, 26]
•	Difference table:
markdown
Copy code
2   5   10   17   26
    3    5    7     9
        2    2     2
Prediction: The second-level difference is constant (2). The next term is 37.
________________________________________
4. Multi-Level (ML)
Searches for patterns in diagonals of the difference or ratio table.
Example:
Input series: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
•	Table:
markdown
Copy code
1   3   6   10   15
    2   3    4    5
       1    1     1
Prediction: Using diagonal increments (1 at the second level), the next term is 21.
________________________________________
5. Focusing (FOC)
Divides the original series into smaller subseries and identifies the implicit pattern in each.
Example:
Input series: [1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5]
Subseries:
•	Odd indices: [1, 2, 3] (Arithmetic progression with difference +1)
•	Even indices: [3, 4, 5] (Arithmetic progression with difference +1)
Prediction: Combine patterns; the next terms are [4, 6].
________________________________________
6. Analogy (ANA)
Breaks the original series into groups, checks for constancy within rows of difference/ratio tables for groups, and predicts missing elements based on group analogies.
Example:
Input series: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]
Group into: [2, 4, 6] and [8, 10, 12]
Prediction: Extend by adding 2 repeatedly: [14, 16, 18].
________________________________________
7. Exponentiation (EXP)
Transforms the series by raising each element to a certain power or taking roots to reveal simpler patterns.
Example:
Input series: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
•	Apply square roots: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (Arithmetic progression with difference +1)
Prediction: Extend and square: [36, 49].
________________________________________
8. Logarithm (LOG)
Computes logarithms of consecutive terms to identify exponential relationships.
Example:
Input series: [2, 4, 16, 256]
•	Logarithmic table:
scss
Copy code
log2(4) = 2
log2(16) = 4
log2(256) = 8
Prediction: Exponential pattern, log2(Next term) = 16, so the next term is 65536.
________________________________________
9. Double Operation (DOP)
Alternates between two basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition and subtraction) for consecutive pairs in the series.
Example:
Input series: [3, 5, 2, 4, 1]
Operations:
•	Add 2 → Subtract 3 → Add 2 → Subtract 3 Prediction: Add 2: The next term is 3.
________________________________________
10. Specular Symmetry (SSYM)
Detects a symmetric arrangement in the series, with elements repeating in reverse order.
Example:
Input series: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Prediction: Mirror the pattern to predict next terms: [2, 3, 2, 1].
________________________________________
11. Repetition Symmetry (RSYM)
Finds repeating groups in the series and extends the series by repeating the detected group.
Example:
Input series: [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
Repeating group: [1, 2, 3]
Prediction: Extend group: [1, 2, 3].
________________________________________
12. Different Groups of Equal Elements (DGE)
Groups consecutive elements with the same value and analyzes patterns in group sizes and values.
Example:
Input series: [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]
Groups:
•	Values: [1, 2, 3]
•	Lengths: [2, 3, 4]
Prediction: Next group is [4] repeated 5 times.

Conclusion
These algorithms cover diverse scenarios to identify and predict patterns in numerical sequences. Using Python, you can implement them systematically to solve IQ-like series problems or apply them to broader datasets like OEIS. Let me know if you'd like implementation details for any of these!
